# Digital-wallet

In this project I designed a digital wallet using Proteus
there is a keypad which we can use to enter password or the value we want
the wallet can save the password and whenever you want to enter, you just need to turn the wallet on and then enter your password, if it's true, you are in
once you are in ,you can deposit or withdraw money
